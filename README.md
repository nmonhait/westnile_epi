Visualizing demographic patterns of West Nile Virus in Illinois, 2005-2012



Kathleen Wendt, Nichole Monhait, Randy Xun, and Jessy Jiao



As our final project in ERHS 535 (R Programming for Research) at Colorado State University, we created a Shiny app with an interactive map of the state of Illinois to depict the county-level trends of West Nile Virus cases in humans by year (2005-2012) and gender.
