Each group will need to generate:

1. R code for project.

2. A brief report (4 to 5 pages) describing how the group tackled their
problem, what pieces were particularly challenging and how they
tackled those, what they would do differently if they started fresh,
and what interesting things they found in this set of data. Each group
must submit a draft of this the last Wednesday of class and submit
the final version on the day of presentations.

3. A presentation (12 minutes maximum) that covers the same material
as the report. The groups will present these during finals week, in the
time period scheduled for a final exam for our course.
